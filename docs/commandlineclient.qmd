# iBridges CLI
The iBridges CLI is a command line interface to up and download large amounts of data. It only updates data when necessary, i.e. if checksums of files differ.

## Configuration

The client uses the same configuration files as the GUI, i.e. the *irods_environment.json* and the *ibridges_config.json*.

- Please create a directory `~/.irods` and place your `irods_environment.json` there:
	- Linux: /home/\<username\>/.irods/irods_environment.json
	- Mac: /Users/\<username\>/.irods/irods_environment.json
	- Windows: C:\\\\....\\\<username\>\\.irods\\irods_environment.json	

- Please create a directory named `~/.ibridges`. You can start the client and let the configuration file `~/.ibridges/ibridges_config.json` be created.

- If your iRODS instance does not provide information on available storage through the resource metadata *free_space*, please make sure to have the following setting in `~/.ibridges/ibridges_config.json`
    
    ```sh
    "check_free_space": false,
    "force_transfers": true,
    ```

## Commandline parameters

- ` --irods_path IRODS_PATH, -i IRODS_PATH`: mandatory
- `--operation {upload,download}, -o {upload,download}`: mandatory, direction of data transfer
