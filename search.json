    "text": "The iBridgesGui is a GUI to an Data management platform based on iRODS. It exposes iRODS functionality through a GUI to the users. We divided the different function into groups where each function group is represented in an own tab in the GUI. The tabs are configured for the user depending on the user’s rights and role in the Data management platform. - The Browser is a tool to browse through iRODS collections and gather information on iRODS data objects - The Up and Download tab gives tools to up and download large data safely. - The ELN Data upload tab is made for specific data uploads that belong to an Experiment described in an ElabJournal instance. - In the Compress/bundle data tab the user is given tools to bundle (tar) or compress (zip) iRODS data collections and to extract them again.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Download\n\n\nTo browse through your data collections in iRODS click on the Browser tab.\n\nNavigation bar: Type a valid collection or object path in and hit enter.\nCollection and data object table:\n\nClick on the Name of a collection or option. This will load the tabs below the table (see below)\nDouble click on a collection to navigate into the collection\n\nLower tabs\n\nPreview: Lists the content of a collection or the first 50 lines of textual data (.txt, .json, .csv)\nMetadata: You can annotate collections and data objects with own annotation key, value, unit. The keys and values can be used in the search-drop down menu to look for data\nPermissions: Will show the permissions own(er), read, write. If you have the role of data steward, you will also be able to change and add permissions\nResources: The tab shows on which storage resource data objects are stored. Note, collections do not have a resource.\nDelete: In the browser table click on the collection or object you want to delete, then click Load and then Delete. This will delete a whole collection with all its members or the data object.\n\n\nNote: The File Upload and File download buttons are only meant for uploading and downloading small single files. For large data transfers click on the Up and Download tab.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Download\n\n\n\nSelect the iRODS collection or data object to download and the folder to download to.\nPress the download button. A pop up window opens and the difference between the source and destination is calculated: - Based on checksums, a unique hash for each file the GUI determines whether the source file and the destination file are identical. If so, the file will not be downloaded again. The GUI will only download data which does not exist or differs.\n\nThe GUI also computes the total size of the data objects and will only start the download if the total amount will fit on your destination file system.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload dialog\n\n\nWhen the check is done the loading screen disappears and the number of files which exist with a different checksum (1) and files which only exist on iRODS (2) will be indicated. Press the Download button to start the file transfer. iRODS automatically checks the checksum to ensure all downloaded files are complete.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Download\n\n\n\nCheck the resource. There may be several storage resources configured for you in the system. Your iRODS admin will give you advice which one to use for which data and workflow. Note, that archive resources are made to archive large files. Please adhere for those resources to the following policy:\n\nFiles need to be 1GB or larger.\nDo not start calculations on data which is stored on archive resources. They have a low latency and will inhibit your program. Your iRODS administrator can help you to migrate the data to a suited resources in that case.\n\nSelect the local file or folder and iRODS collection to upload to.\nPress the upload button. As in the download, a pop up window will appear which will execute the same checks as for the data downloads.\n\n\n\n\nDownload dialog\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can bundle a collection that contains small files into one large tar file or even compress a collection into a zip file. Those files can then be safely put on the archive resources or, in case of zip, be used to reduce storage space.\n\n\n\nHow to Compress\n\n\n\nSelect the collection you want to compress\nSelect the storage resource on which the compressed or bundled data should be stored\nCheck Compress data to create a zip-file. If unchecked, a tar-file will be created\nCheck Remove collection if you just want to keep the tar or zip file.\nThe Create tar/zip compress the data into the file <collection_name>.irods.tar or <collection_name>.irods.zip\n\nNote, all you metadata will be preserved too and restored upon extraction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Compress\n\n\nPartial extract of data:\n\nSelect the *.irods.tar or *.irods.zip file.\nSelect the resource where the data should be extracted to.\nUse the Index button to get an overview of the files inside the tarred file. The JSON tab will show the whole data package in JSON format including accession rights and metadata. Select the files you want to extract and click on Extract Selected. This schedules a job on the iRODS server which will extract the data. Note, that this might take a while. Close the window and navigate to the browser to see whether the data is restored.\n\n\n\nClick on Options in the menu bar of the window and select Search. This will open a mask to search for data objects and collections using metadata key-value pairs, collection paths and data object paths.\nThe Select and Close button will load the selected collections and objects into the Browser tab where you can further inspect and annotate the data."

Place that file into the .irods directory/folder. Here is an example that can be created with the iinit iCommands on Linux:\n\n{\n    \"irods_host\": \"server.fqdn.nl\", \n    \"irods_port\": 1247, \n    \"irods_user_name\": \"username\", \n    \"irods_zone_name\": \"myZone\", \n    \"irods_default_resource\": \"myResc\" \n}\n\n\niBridges config.json\niBridges will create its own configuration file in ~/.ibridges/ containing the name of the last iRODS environment file used.

These can be either catalog or resource servers. Please add the following to the /etc/irods/core.re or another rule engine file:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample storage capacity rule\n\n\n\n\n\n######################################################\n# Storage capacity policies.\n# Update the metadata field free_space of the resource\n# when data is moved there or deleted from it.\n#\n# Author: Christine Staiger (2021)\n#######################################################\n\nacPostProcForParallelTransferReceived(*leaf_resource) {\n    msiWriteRodsLog(\"LOGGING: acPostProcForParallelTransferReceived\", *Status);\n    msi_update_unixfilesystem_resource_free_space(*leaf_resource);\n}\n\nacPostProcForDataCopyReceived(*leaf_resource) {\n    msiWriteRodsLog(\"LOGGING: acPostProcForDataCopyReceived\", *Status);\n    msi_update_unixfilesystem_resource_free_space(*leaf_resource);\n}\n\n# for iput\nacPostProcForPut {\n    msi_update_unixfilesystem_resource_free_space($KVPairs.rescName);\n}\n\n# for storage update after irmtrash\nacPostProcForDelete {\n    msi_update_unixfilesystem_resource_free_space($KVPairs.rescName);\n}\nFor very busy systems, updating this value for every upload or delete can be prevented by commenting out or removing the last two stanzas if performance is being hampered.\n\n\n\nFor more complex resource hierarchies, the top of the resource tree (the root node) will usually not be updated with the free space values, but if it is (the sum of all leaf nodes is asssumed), the value in any leaf nodes will be ignored. If the root node has no free space value, the sum of the leaf nodes will be used instead. If none of the resource nodes are annotated, an error will occur. This feature can be overridden by annotating the root node’s free space value with an arbitrarily large value. Please note, that this action disables the built-in protection offered by this client.\n\n\nData (un)bundling\niRODS 4.2.x currently has no support for compressed structured files outside the iCommand ibun. Therefore, without custom microservices installed on a given iRODS server, only uncompressed TAR files are supported.\n\nTAR file format\nThe ibun help gives the example to use the -C option to change into the directory containing the potential contents of the TAR file. The bundling done with iBridges assumes this same format and creates TAR files likewise. For example bundling the contents of the collection /testZone/home/user/testColl containing:\n/testZone/home/user/testColl/file1.ext\n/testZone/home/user/testColl/file2.ext\n/testZone/home/user/testColl/file3.ext\nstores only the three data objects:\nfile1.ext\nfile2.ext\nfile3.ext\ninto /testZone/home/user/testColl.tar. Unbundling this data object recreates the /testZone/home/user/testColl collection if it does not exist and deposits the data objects into it. If there are already data objects or collections existing there, an error will result and the bundle will not be extracted.\n\n\n(Un)bundle options\niBridges has one option for (un)bundling data: Force operations. If the option is checked, two types of operations will be forced: one is to overwrite a bundle/collection that already exists, and the other is to remove the bundle files or collection contents without first sending them to the bin. If this behavior is undesirable, DO NOT USE THIS FORCE OPTION.\nIt is recommended that any kind of destructive actions be done in a separate step."

If you want to create your own tab, please follow the steps below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Create a ui-file\n\n\n\n\n\nTo help you to create a nice layout of the new tab we recommend to use the QT-designer. Please choose Qt Designer Form and the template Widget.\n\n\n\n\n\nSet the Path to <iBridges-Gui/gui/ui-files>\nTo ensure the same color theme, right-click on Form and choose change the stylesheet.\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy the following text over to the window.\nQWidget\n{\n    background-color: rgb(54, 54, 54);\n    color: rgb(86, 184, 139);\n    border-color: rgb(217, 174, 23);\n}\n\nQLineEdit\n{\n    background-color: rgb(85, 87, 83);\n    border-color: rgb(217, 174, 23);\n}\n\nQTreeView\n{\nbackground-color: rgb(85, 87, 83);\n}\n\nQLabel#error_label\n{\n    color: rgb(217, 174, 23);\n}\nThe errorLabel is a specific object, while the settings for Qwidget, QLineEdit and QTreeView are valid for all objects of that type.\nNow you can design your new form. In our example the form contains a placeholder for the iRODS tree, a text field (green text) and an error label (yellow text).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the designer you also set the variable names of the objects. These will be used in the python code, so make sure they are meaningful to you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Convert the ui-file into python code\n\n\n\n\n\nConvert the ui-file to python file with:\ncd iBridges-Gui\npython -m PyQt6.uic.pyuic -x gui/ui_files/ExampleTab.ui -o gui/ui_files/ExampleTab.py\nIn some cases a standard class name is set in the python file.\n# Form implementation generated from reading ui file 'gui/ui_files/example_tab.ui'\n#\n# Created by: PyQt6 UI code generator 6.3.1\n#\n# WARNING: Any manual changes made to this file will be lost when pyuic6 is\n# run again.  Do not edit this file unless you know what you are doing.\n\n\nfrom PyQt6 import QtCore, QtGui, QtWidgets\n\n\nclass Ui_Form(object):\n    def setupUi(self, Form):\n        Form.setObjectName(\"Form\")\n        ...\nYou can change the class name Ui_Form to something more meaningful. In this example, we rename the class to Ui_ExampleTab.\nWe provide a full example file in iBridges/gui/IrodsExampleTab.py.\nThis is the minimum code you need to initialise the new tab in the GUI:\nimport logging\nimport sys\n\nimport PyQt6.QtCore\nimport PyQt6.QtGui\nimport PyQt6.QtWidgets\nimport PyQt6.uic\n\nimport gui\nimport meta\nimport utils\nfrom gui.irodsTreeView import IrodsModel\n\nclass IrodsExampleTab(PyQt6.QtWidgets.QWidget,\n                   gui.ui_files.ExampleTab.Ui_ExampleTab):\n    context = utils.context.Context()\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        if getattr(sys, 'frozen', False):\n            super().setupUi(self)\n        else:\n            PyQt6.uic.loadUi(\"gui/ui_files/ExampleTab.ui\", self)\n        self.error_label.setText(\"Whooohoo\")\nFor the software package to find the layout for the new tab, we need to add it to the iBridges/gui/ui_files/init.py. Add the line:\nfrom . import ExampleTab\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Integrate the new tab into iBridges\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new python class iBridges/gui/IrodsExampleTab.py\nAdd from . import IrodsExampleTab to iBridges/gui/init.py\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Integrate the new tab class into mainmenu.py\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the file iBridges/gui/mainmenu.py you will find the dictionary ui_tabs_lookup. The dictionary maps from <tabname> (as used in ibridges_config.json) to a function in mainmeny.py which initialises the tab. First we will add the new name:\nui_tabs_lookup = {\n    'tabBrowser': self.setupTabBrowser,\n    ...\n    'tabInfo': self.setupTabInfo,\n    'tabExample': self.setupTabExample\n}\nNow we need to write the function setupTabExample Add the new function setupTabBrowser:\n    def setupTabExample(self):\n        self.exampleTab = gui.ExampleTab.ExampleTab()\n        self.tabWidget.addTab(self.exampleTab, 'Example')\nDon’t forget to add the new keyword to the tabs in your ibridges_config.json\nNow the new tab should appear as last tab in the application and we can continue defining its behaviour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Defining the functionality of the new tab\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might have observed that we already defined a variable context as a global variable. The class utils.context.Context contains all parameters from the irods_environment.json, ibridges_config.json and it contains an object context.irods_connector.\nimport utils\ncontext = utils.context.Context()\ndir(context)\n\n[\n 'application_name',\n 'ibridges_conf_file',\n 'ibridges_configuration',\n 'ienv_is_complete',\n 'irods_connector',\n 'irods_env_file',\n 'irods_environment',\n 'reset',\n 'save_ibridges_configuration',\n 'save_irods_environment']\nThe class Context is a singleton, i.e. no matter how often you instantiate a Context object there will always and only be one object in memory.\ncontext = utils.context.Context()\ncontext1 = utils.context.Context()\n\ncontext == context1\nTrue\nThat also means that if you change the values in the object, all other classes using Context will have the same information.\nirods_connector contains all functionality to interact with the iRODS server.\nWith all that you can define the functionality of the tab like in the example we provide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Path handling in iRODS\n\n\n\n\n\niRODS paths of data objects and collections are given as strings:\nimport utils\nimport irodsConnector\ncontext = utils.context.Context()\ncontext.irods_env_file = utils.path.LocalPath(\"~/.irods/irods_environment.json\").expanduser()\ncontext.irods_connector = irodsConnector.manager.IrodsConnector()\ncontext.irods_connector.irods_env_file = context.irods_env_file\ncontext.irods_connector.irods_environment = context.irods_environment\ncontext.irods_connector.password = \"************\"\ncontext.irods_connector.connect()\ncoll = context.irods_connector.data_op.get_collection(\"/<zone>/home/<coll_name>\")\n\ntype(coll.path)\nstr\nThe class utils.path.IrodsPath turns such a string into a pure POSIX path without file system functionality. We also offer the complementary functionality for local paths in utils.path.LocalPath.\ndir(utils.path.IrodsPath)\n\n['capitalize', 'casefold', 'center', 'count', 'encode', 'endswith', \n'expandtabs', 'find', 'format', 'format_map', 'index', 'isalnum', \n'isalpha', 'isascii', 'isdecimal', 'isdigit', 'isidentifier', 'islower', \n'isnumeric', 'isprintable', 'isspace', 'istitle', 'isupper', 'join', \n'joinpath', ...]\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to contribute to the iBridges code base, you can submit pull requests."
