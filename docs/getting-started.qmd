title: "iBridges configuration"
---
The iRODS GUI works with iRODS instances of versions 4.2.11, 4.2.12 and 4.3.0. 

Here, we show how to configure the application to work your specific iRODS instance.
*Please note*, that some features (tab views in the GUI) depend on certain server settings. You will find those dependencies at the end of the document.

## System dependencies
- Python: you will need Python 3.9 or higher
- pip: to install package dependencies you will need pip3, version 22.2.2 or higher

## Installation
::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
### Install from git
```sh
git clone git@github.com:chStaiger/iBridges-Gui.git
cd iBridges-Gui
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can already start the application with

```sh
./iBridges.py 
#or
python iBridges.py
```
Please see below how to configure the software to connect to your iRODS instance.

## Configuration
### iRODS environment.json

- Please create a directory `~/.irods`
- Your *iRODS* admin will provide an `irods_environment.json` file, its contents, or instructions on how to create it.  Place that file into the `.irods` directory/folder.
  - Linux: `/home/\<username\>/.irods/irods_environment.json`
  - Mac: `/Users/\<username\>/.irods/irods_environment.json`
  - Windows: `C:\\\\....\\\<username\>\\.irods\\irods_environment.json`

-   Here is an example that can be created with the `iinit` iCommands on Linux:

```json
{
    "irods_host": "server.fqdn.nl", 
    "irods_port": 1247, 
    "irods_user_name": "username", 
    "irods_zone_name": "myZone", 
    "irods_default_resource": "myResc" 
}
```

### iBridges config.json

*iBridges* will create its own configuration file in `~/.ibridges/ibridges_config.json` containing the name of the last *iRODS* environment file used.  This `ibridges_config.json` file can be updated to control other aspects of *iBridges*.  For example:

```json
{
    "last_ienv": "irods_environment.json",
    "davrods_server": "https://server.fqdn.nl",
    "eln_token": "<api key>",
    "amber_token": "<api key>"
    "ui_tabs": [
        "tabUpDownload",
        "tabELNData",
        "tabAmberWorkflow"
        "tabDataBundle",
        "tabCreateTicket"
    ],
    "force_transfers": false,
    "check_free_space": false
}
```
Options:

- `davrods_server`: the address of a [webdav server](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/davrods), used to create entries in [ElabJournal](https://www.elabnext.com/products/elabjournal/)
- `eln_token`, `amber_token`: API keys for `tabELNData` or `tabAmberWorkflow` respectively
- `ui_tabs`: configure which tabs are shown (Browser and Info tabs always are)
    - `tabUpDownload`: a two-pane upload/download tab
    - `tabELNData`: for the Electronic Lab Notebook, eLabJournal
    - `tabAmberWorkflow`: up and download data to and from [Amberscript](https://www.amberscript.com/en/) directly from iRODS.
    - `tabDataBundle`: (un)bundle datasets from/to four supported formats
    - `tabCreateTicket`: create iRODS tickets for anonymous access
- `force_transfers`: always write data to iRODS
- `check_free_space`: checks the metadata *free_space* of resources and only shows resources with a *free_space* larger than 0.

The order of the list `ui_tabs` defines in which order the tabs will be presented in the GUI. By default the first tab is always the iRODS Browser and the last tab is always the Info tab; [see here](userdoc.qmd). These two tabs will always be loaded even when no tabs are configured.


The `check_free_space` and `force_transfers` options are *REQUIRED* and if not provided will be added automatically. The default values are  

```py
"check_free_space": true,
"force_transfers": false
```

However, if the iRODS instance does not provide information about free space through the resource's metadata *free_space*, no resources will be shown and no uploads will be allowed.

To enable and allow data transfers in case *free_space* is not set, set the options to:

```py
"check_free_space": false,
"force_transfers": true
```

This setting makes top-level resources which are not annotated with their free space visible in the drop-down menus allowing selection of them.  In addition, it sets the `force` flag for uploads overriding resource overflow protection.

The logs for both GUI and CLI clients can be found in `~/.ibridges/iBridges.log`.

## Usage

```sh
export PYTHON_IRODSCLIENT_DEFAULT_XML=QUASI_XML
python iBridges.py
```

or

```sh
env PYTHON_IRODSCLIENT_DEFAULT_XML=QUASI_XML ./iBridges.py
```


## iRODS server dependencies
### Storage capacity

To protect the *iRODS* resources from overflowing you should install an event hook on the *iRODS* servers that fill the resources' `RESC_FREE_SPACE` attribute in the iCAT.  These can be either *catalog* or *resource* servers.  Please add the following to the `/etc/irods/core.re` or another rule engine file:

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
### Example storage capacity rule

```py
######################################################
# Storage capacity policies.
# Update the metadata field free_space of the resource
# when data is moved there or deleted from it.
#
# Author: Christine Staiger (2021)
#######################################################

acPostProcForParallelTransferReceived(*leaf_resource) {
    msiWriteRodsLog("LOGGING: acPostProcForParallelTransferReceived", *Status);
    msi_update_unixfilesystem_resource_free_space(*leaf_resource);
}

acPostProcForDataCopyReceived(*leaf_resource) {
    msiWriteRodsLog("LOGGING: acPostProcForDataCopyReceived", *Status);
    msi_update_unixfilesystem_resource_free_space(*leaf_resource);
}

# for iput
acPostProcForPut {
    msi_update_unixfilesystem_resource_free_space($KVPairs.rescName);
}

# for storage update after irmtrash
acPostProcForDelete {
    msi_update_unixfilesystem_resource_free_space($KVPairs.rescName);
}
```

For very busy systems, updating this value for every upload or delete can be prevented by commenting out or removing the last two stanzas if performance is being hampered.
:::

For more complex resource hierarchies, the top of the resource tree (the _root_ node) will usually not be updated with the free space values, but if it is (the sum of all _leaf_ nodes is asssumed), the value in any _leaf_ nodes will be ignored.  If the _root_ node has no free space value, the sum of the _leaf_ nodes will be used instead.  If none of the resource nodes are annotated, an error will occur.  This feature can be overridden by annotating the _root_ node's free space value with an arbitrarily large value.  _*Please note, that this action disables the built-in protection offered by this client.*_

### Resource status
In the tab *Info* users can view the `status` of the resources. This metadata can be set by admins:

```sh
iadmin modresc <resource name> status <String>
```

### Data (un)bundling

iRODS 4.2.x currently has no support for compressed structured files outside the iCommand `ibun`.  Therefore, without custom microservices installed on a given iRODS server, only uncompressed TAR files are supported.

#### TAR file format

The `ibun` help gives the example to use the `-C` option to change into the directory containing the potential contents of the TAR file.  The bundling done with iBridges assumes this same format and creates TAR files likewise.  For example bundling the contents of the collection `/testZone/home/user/testColl` containing:

```commandline
/testZone/home/user/testColl/file1.ext
/testZone/home/user/testColl/file2.ext
/testZone/home/user/testColl/file3.ext
```

stores only the three data objects:

```commandline
file1.ext
file2.ext
file3.ext
```

into `/testZone/home/user/testColl.tar`.  Unbundling this data object recreates the `/testZone/home/user/testColl` collection if it does not exist and deposits the data objects into it.  If there are already data objects or collections existing there, an error will result and the bundle will not be extracted.

#### (Un)bundle options

iBridges has one option for (un)bundling data: `Force operations`.  If the option is checked, two types of operations will be forced: one is to overwrite a bundle/collection that already exists, and the other is to remove the bundle files or collection contents without first sending them to the bin.  **If this behavior is undesirable, DO NOT USE THIS FORCE OPTION.**

It is recommended that any kind of destructive actions be done in a separate step.
